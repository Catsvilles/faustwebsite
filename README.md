# Faust Website

This repository contains the source of the Faust website which is currently
deployed at <https://faust.grame.fr>.

## Organization

The website uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (which is dynamically
included in all pages). Beside that, the site is completely static and is 
generated by running the `build` script. Running `build` will generate a
`/site` folder containing the site. This folder can be deployed anywhere.

* `/css`: contains all the CSS files (mostly overriding some bootstrap classes)
    * `/css/faust-widgets.css`: the CSS for the Faust widget used in the
    documentation.
    * `/css/faust.css`: the main CSS of the website.
* `/lib`: contains the html source code of the hearders, footers and 
navigation bars
    * `/lib/footer-content.html`: the content of the footer (e.g., extra navigation
    links, etc.).
    * `/lib/footer-includes.html`: any includes to be placed in the footer
    (mostly JS scripts).
    * `/lib/header-includes.html`: any includes to be placed in the header
    (e.g., CSS, scripts, etc.).
    * `/lib/navigation.html`: the source of the nav bar of the website.
    * `/lib/std-header.html`: the source of the header.
* `/script`: shell scripts called to generate the various parts of the website.
* `/src`: the source code of the website.
* `build`: the script to call to build the website.
