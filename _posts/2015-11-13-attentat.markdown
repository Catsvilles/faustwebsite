_Tossed but not sunk_. Ten month after January 2015 shouting at Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Casher, Paris has been again attacked.

We are at war against Islamic fundamentalism, a particularly cowardly enemy who kills disarmed people in newspapers, planes, supermarkets, beaches, museums, concert halls,... We are at war against religious obscurantism in all its stupidity and all its inhumanity. Our thoughts go to the victims and their family.
