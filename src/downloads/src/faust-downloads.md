# Faust Downloads

Faust comes in many different forms and it can be confusing to know what to 
install to start using this tool. We recommend you to have a look at the
[overview of the Faust universe section of the Faust manual](../doc/manual/index.html#overview-of-the-faust-universe). That being 
said, most of the features of Faust are accessible through the 
[Faust online editor](../tools/editor), so we recommend most people to use this
tool which doesn't require any installation. Now, if you really wish to have
a local version of Faust on your system, this page should give you an overview
of the options that you have.

> This page is a work in progress... We aim at facilitating the installation of
Faust and of some of its associated tools by providing pre-compiled binaries
and installation packages. However, at this point we recommend Faust users
to compile [Faust/`libfaust`](faust-compiler-libfaust), [FaustLive](#faustlive), 
[Faustgen](#faustgen), and [FaustWorks](#faustworks).
