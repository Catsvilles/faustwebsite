### The Faust compiler ###
The Faust compiler itself comes in two flavors : Faust and Faust2 :

+ [Faust (master branch)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/faust-0.9.73.tgz/download) is simple to compile and install as it has very few dependencies, but it can only generate C++ programs.
+ The [faust2 branch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/faust-0.9.73.tgz/download) is more general and has backends for C++, C, Java, Javascript, asm.js, LLVM. But is has more dependencies, in particular LLVM. Faust2 is needed to compile FaustLive and other embedded Faust compilers for [Max/MSP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/faustgen-0.87.tgz/download), Csound and [Processing](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/faustProcessing.zip/download).

You can also clone the git repository with the following command :

	git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/faudiostream/code faust


### Faustlive ###
FaustLive is the recommended tool to get started with Faust. Thanks to its embedded compiler, FaustLive provides an ultra-short edit-compile-run cycle. Moreover FaustLive is multi-platform and doesn't require any additional compiler or development tool (beside a simple code editor).

+ [FaustLive for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/FaustLive-Windows-2.30.zip/download)
+ [FaustLive for Windows+jack](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/FaustLive-Windows-Jack-2.30.zip/download)
